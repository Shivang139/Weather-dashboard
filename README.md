# Weather Dashboard

A simple and clean web application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific city.

## Description

This project is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data from a third-party API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc. - **Please specify which one you used**) and displays it in an easy-to-understand format. Users can input a city name to get up-to-date weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, and a multi-day forecast.

## Features

* **City Search:** Find weather information for any city around the world.
* **Current Weather:** Displays current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rain), humidity, and wind speed.
* **Forecast:** Shows a weather forecast for the upcoming days (e.g., 5-day forecast - **Adjust if different**).
* **Clean UI:** Simple and intuitive user interface.
* **(Optional: Add other features like saving recent searches, using geolocation, etc. if applicable)**
